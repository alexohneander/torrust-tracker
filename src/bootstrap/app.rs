//! Setup for the main tracker application.
//!
//! The [`setup`] only builds the application and its dependencies but it does not start the application.
//! In fact, there is no such thing as the main application process. When the application starts, the only thing it does is
//! starting a bunch of independent jobs. If you are looking for how things are started you should read [`app::start`](crate::app::start)
//! function documentation.
//!
//! Setup steps:
//!
//! 1. Load the global application configuration.
//! 2. Initialize static variables.
//! 3. Initialize logging.
//! 4. Initialize the domain tracker.
